![Posterior over hypotheses and the corresponding predictive distribution after seeing one example, D = {16}. A dot means this number is consistent with this hypothesis. The graph p(h|D) on the right is the weight given to hypothesis h. By taking a weighed sum of dots, we get p(˜x ∈ C|D) (top). Based on Figure 2.9 of (Tenenbaum 1999).

![(a) Updating a Beta(2, 2) prior with a Binomial likelihood with sufficient statistics N1 = 3,N0 =17 to yield a Beta(5,19) posterior. (b) Updating a Beta(5, 2) prior with a Binomial likelihood with sufficient statistics N1 =11,N0 =13 to yield a Beta(16, 15) posterior.
